# Given an unsorted array of integers,
# find the length of longest continuous increasing subsequence.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
# Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence,
# it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 
# Example 2:
# Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1. 
# Note: Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.
