# Given a non-empty, singly linked list with head node head,
# return a middle node of linked list.
#
# If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: Node 3 from this list (Serialization: [3,4,5])
# The returned node has value 3.  (The judge's serialization of this node is [3,4,5]).
# Note that we returned a ListNode object ans, such that:
# ans.val = 3, ans.next.val = 4, ans.next.next.val = 5, and ans.next.next.next = NULL.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
# Output: Node 4 from this list (Serialization: [4,5,6])
# Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
#
# Note:
# - The number of nodes in the given list will be between 1 and 100.
