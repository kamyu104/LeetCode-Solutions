# Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or
# object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file
# or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link
# to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
#
# Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. 
# There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization
# algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can 
# be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the 
# original tree structure.
#
# For example, you may serialize the following tree
#
#     1
#   / \
#   2   3
#      / \
#     4   5
# as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]", just the same as how LeetCode OJ serializes
# a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so 
# please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
# Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. 
# Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.
