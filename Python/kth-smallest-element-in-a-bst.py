# Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.
#
# Note: 
# You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.
#
# Follow up:
# What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and
# you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?
