### **Slide 1: The Problem & Solution**

**Problem: Static Volatility Models Miss Real-Time Market Dynamics**

- Traditional volatility models rely on static historical estimates that often lag behind real-time market changes.
- Market volatility is influenced by sudden events, drops in liquidity, and spikes that aren't captured quickly enough by standard models.
- Static models can lead to poor trading decisions:
  - If volatility is higher than expected, orders are placed too shallow, reducing the chance of execution at favorable prices.
  - If volatility is lower than expected, deep orders might never get filled, forcing costly market sweeps.

**Solution: Dynamic Volatility Adjustment Using By-Power Variance**

- Our new model dynamically adjusts historical volatility estimates with real-time data.
- By incorporating **by-power variance**, we account for real-time shifts in market behavior, making the model adaptive to current conditions.
- The model smooths out jumps and outliers, unlike realized variance, leading to more stable and accurate estimates of volatility.

### **Slide 2: Our Approach**

**1. Historical Volatility Estimate**

- Based on the last 60 days of stock returns, we calculate the next dayâ€™s volatility as our baseline estimate.

**2. Real-Time Adjustments During Trading Hours**

- Every minute, we calculate an approximation of realized variance using **by-power variance**, which is more robust against market jumps.
- The model continuously updates the historical estimate with dynamic real-time data, reflecting recent market activity, including volatility spikes and liquidity drops.

**3. Scaling to 1,200 Stocks**

- This model updates volatility in real-time for 1,200 stocks in our universe, providing continuous updates throughout the trading day.
- Volatility estimates are refreshed every minute, ensuring we stay current with the evolving market.

### **Slide 3: Business Impact & Client Benefits**

**1. Improved Order Placement for Better Execution**

- **Higher volatility**: Enables deeper, more passive order placement, increasing the likelihood of execution at more favorable prices.
- **Lower volatility**: Prevents placing orders too deep, reducing the need for market sweeps, thus saving costs on trading fees.

**2. Adaptability to Market Conditions**

- The dynamic nature of the model adjusts quickly to market events, spikes in volatility, and changes in liquidity.
- Clients benefit from **more precise limit order placement** based on up-to-the-minute volatility conditions.

**3. Enhanced Risk Management**

- Smoother volatility estimates mean fewer outliers, reducing the risk of poor trade execution caused by sudden market jumps.
- More accurate volatility predictions lead to better trading strategies and more efficient capital allocation.

### **Optional Slide 4: Potential for Customization & Scalability**

(*Optional for further business discussion or future additions*)

- **Customization**: The model can be tailored to fit the specific risk profiles and trading strategies of different clients.
- **Scalability**: Expandable across more stocks and adaptable to different asset classes or timeframes, making it flexible for a wide range of trading environments.
